The python_in_chemistry pages are a series of resources for students and educators alike. They aim to combine an introduction to the Python programming language with an understanding of chemistry. 

This site will introduce a range of resources, covering how to get started with Python and how to make use of Jupyter notebooks. While allowing students to consolidate chemistry knowledge learnt in lectures and tutorials. 

If this is the first time you have tried Python, we recommend starting with the [Basics](/tag/basics/) resources, in particular a great first introduction can be found in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) resources. 

This open-source project is run from the University of Bath by: 

- [Dr. Fiona Dickinson](http://www.bath.ac.uk/chemistry/contacts/academics/fiona-dickinson/)
- [Dr. Ben Morgan](http://www.analysisandsynthesis.com/)
- [Mr. Andrew McCluskey](http://people.bath.ac.uk/arm61)

If you want to get involved and help to write for python_in_chemistry please get in touch with any of the people above.
