The best way to get started with python_in_chemistry is by working through the Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks series. These will cover:

- an introduction to Jupyter notebooks and allow you to run them online through Binder;
- performing simple calculations, and using the `math` module;
- working with variables;
- different data types: integers and floats, strings, lists, and numpy arrays; 
- plotting data with `matplotlib`; 
- basic data analysis and statistics with `numpy`. 

These can be worked through from the links below:
