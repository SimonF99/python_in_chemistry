On the surface this notebook simply exemplfies the use of the <code>np.argmax</code> and <code>np.amax</code> functions, however it also includes a series of other delights:

- in addition to using <code>scipy.constants</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, it shows using colours in the plots;
- using functions is revisited;
- <code>print()</code> is joined by an example of created Markdown objects with code, so that units can be presented using LaTeX formatting.
