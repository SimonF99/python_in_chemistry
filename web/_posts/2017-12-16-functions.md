This notebook introduces the concept of **functions** in terms of the Python language. I endevoured to use examples of *chemistry* related problems, but occasionally examples from physics or mathematics will come through. 

Like many other programming languages Python lets you use functions -- as a way to write less code. 

The concept of a function should be familar from mathematics, e.g.

$$ f(x) $$

where, $$ f(x) $$ is some mathematical operation that acts on the argument $$ x $$. An example of a function is, 

$$ f(x) = x^2 $$

Using this we can say that $$ f(2) = 4 $$, $$ f(3)=9 $$, etc. 

The use of **functions** is an important paradigm in programming -- the following Jupyter notebook gives a quick introduction to functions and how they can be used.
