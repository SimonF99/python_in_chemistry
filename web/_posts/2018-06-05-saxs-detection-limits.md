A friend runs a blog which discusses the use of small-angle scattering (which is also a major area of work for myself). However, today he posted a blog discussing the [minimum concentration of an analyte required to get a good small angle scattering profile](http://www.lookingatnothing.com/index.php/archives/2645). 

This blog included a Excel spreadsheet detailing how to preform this calculation. And naturally I was immediately keen to show how this could be performed in Python. So linked below is a Jupyter notebook that uses numpy and pandas to reproduce the work of [Brian](http://www.lookingatnothing.com).
