This notebook follows on from the [functions](/functions) notebook. The aim here is to show the utility of **loop** in Python. Again I am aiming to use examples from *chemistry* related problems, but occasionally examples from physics and mathematics will come through. 

As is the case with many aspects of programming, the purpose of a loop is to allow programmers to *write less code*. This leads to the idiom that *computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over*, much better than humans. 

A loop really is just that, a way to tell the computer to perform the same task multiple times.
