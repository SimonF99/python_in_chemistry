[Andrew](http://pythoninchemistry.org/author/andrew/) has developed a small teaching utility designed to introduce students to molecular dynamics. He is currently in the process of trying to develop some example applications in the form of laboratory exercises. In the meantime, more information can be found [here](http://pythoninchemistry.org/pylj).

This utility was applied at the ISIS Neutron Training Course as a component of Andrew's lecture, the material for which can be found in the following post: [introduction-to-md-ntc](http://pythoninchemistry.org/introduction-to-md-ntc).
