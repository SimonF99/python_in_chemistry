Although it is possible to run all of the pre-build resources on this site through the Binder utility (meaning that they are run on an external compute resources). You may want to try writing your on Jupyter notebooks and Python code. 

In order to do that you will have to install Jupyter notebooks locally (e.g. on your own laptop or desktop). This can be achieved by downloading and installing **Anaconda**. This is available for Windows, macOS and Linux [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

Once installed the Jupyter notebooks can be opened, launching a new window in your web browser -- this is the Jupyter file navigator. Using this you can navigate to the folder that interests you and open a new notebook using the 'New' selection box on the right and side. 

If you have any trouble getting Jupyter notebooks running locally, get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pychembath).
