The best way to get started with python_in_chemistry is by working through the Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks series of notebooks. These will work through:

- an introduction to Jupyter notebooks and allow you to run them online through Binder;
- performing simple calculations, and using the <code>math</code> module;
- working with variables;
- different data types: integers and floats, strings, lists, and numpy arrays;
- plotting data with <code>matplotlib</code>;
- basic data analysis and statistics with numpy.

These can be worked through from the links below:
