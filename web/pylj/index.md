pylj is a Python package developed by [Andrew](http://people.bath.ac.uk/arm61) aimed as a teaching aid for molecular simulation in undergraduate laboratories. 

If you are interested in using pylj, please drop [Andrew](mailto:arm61@bath.ac.uk) an email or fork the source code, which can be found at the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/arm61/pylj](https://github.com/arm61/pylj)

A rough example which aims to give an impression of how pylj could be used in an undergraduate teachinig laboratory can be downloaded here:

Over time more examples will be added and the current examples will be cleaned up.
