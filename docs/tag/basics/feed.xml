	     <p>While teaching Python for data analysis in the first- and second-year computational labs in Bath, one of the most common questions I receive from students can be answered with this simple response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Please scroll to the bottom of that block of text and read the last bit”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those that have worked with Python before will <em>hopefully</em> know that I am talking about error tracebacks.</p>

<p><strong>Error traceback</strong> is the name for the print out appears when some error is found in the Python code, it is called a traceback because it aims to help you <em>trace back</em> to where the bug is. An example of a simple error traceback can be seen by running the following in a Python interpreter:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we are trying to import the numpy module, but have spelt numpy wrong. This code will return something which looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span>                       <span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ipython</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">73</span><span class="n">b7917897b3</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="o">----&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>

<span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">named</span> <span class="s">'numy'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, at first glance this can appear quite scary. However, just remember that the most important line in an error traceback is the <strong>last one</strong>, for this particular example we have:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">named</span> <span class="s">'numy'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line alone should tell you what the problem in your code is…<strong>should</strong>. Although, remember though that these error traceback messages are written by other humans who originally wrote the code you are using, so the error message may not be perfectly clear. That said, in the above example just by reading the final line of the error traceback we will be able to quickly see that we’ve spelt numpy wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, not all problems can be solved by just reading the last line. The code below shows two possible attempts at using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> function (which should add a number to the end of an array). Here we are trying to add the next two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to the existing array:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this code gives the following error:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here it is not immediately why the error has arisen. The last line of the traceback seems to be incidating sum issue related to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">axis</code>, which in our ignorance about the <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> function, we know nothing about. However, there is another tip to help us solve this problem, which involves the <strong>arrow indicator</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">----&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This arrow incidates which line the error occured on, and is extremely useful as codes become become larger and more convoluted. In the above example the line indicates that the error has arisen on the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">a = np.append(a, 11, 19)</code>, and following investigation of the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.append.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> documentation</a>, we can discover that the incorrect syntax has been used. The second argument needs to be an array (or list) if both numbers are to be added. The number <code class="highlighter-rouge">19</code> was understood to the be <em>axis</em> argument, for which 19 was not an allowed value. The line above features the correct syntax, hence there was no error found.</p>

<p>This of course is only the tip of the iceberg of error tracebacks and the amount of information available in them. But, hopefully this means I stop being asked that same question 50 times a week.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>A lot of the expressions that describe chemical phenomena involve physical constants, such as the speed of light, <script type="math/tex">c</script>, Avogardo’s constant, <script type="math/tex">N_A</script>, Planck’s constant, <script type="math/tex">h</script>, and the Boltzmann constant, <script type="math/tex">k_B</script>. When working with algebraic expressions, it is also important to keep track of the relevant units. Different experiments may conventionally report data in non-S.I. units and these units must be converted for comparing data or calculating chemical properties.</p>

<p>While manipulating units manually (for example, when working through a problem by hand) is an important skill, if you are solving numerical problems using code you ideally want to avoid typing in unit conversions and values for constants. Any numbers that are typed in, are possible places where you could mistype. Mistakes in your code can hopefully be spotted when they produce errors, or from testing that your code produces a known result. Mistakes in numbers typed in are harder to spot, and can propogate through to your results.</p>

<p>To reduce the change of introducing errors, there are two easy techniques you can follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define your constants and unit conversions once by assigned them to variables (conventionally at the top of your code), rather than retyping them each time.</li>
  <li>If possible, read constants and unit conversions automatically from databases.</li>
</ul>

<p>These techniques are illustrated in the notebook below, which shows how to use the <code>scipy.constants</code> database to work more conveniently with physical constants and unit conversions.</p>

	     <p>Although it is possible to run all of the pre-build resources on this site through the Binder utility (meaning that they are run on an external compute resources). You may want to try writing your on Jupyter notebooks and Python code.</p>

<p>In order to do that you will have to install Jupyter notebooks locally (e.g. on your own laptop or desktop). This can be achieved by downloading and installing <strong>Anaconda</strong>. This is available for Windows, macOS and Linux <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed the Jupyter notebooks can be opened, launching a new window in your web browser – this is the Jupyter file navigator. Using this you can navigate to the folder that interests you and open a new notebook using the ‘New’ selection box on the right and side.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble getting Jupyter notebooks running locally, get in touch on <a href="https://twitter.com/pychembath">Twitter</a>.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>This notebook follows on from the <a href="/functions">functions</a> notebook. The aim here is to show the utility of <strong>loop</strong> in Python. Again I am aiming to use examples from <em>chemistry</em> related problems, but occasionally examples from physics and mathematics will come through.</p>

<p>As is the case with many aspects of programming, the purpose of a loop is to allow programmers to <em>write less code</em>. This leads to the idiom that <em>computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over</em>, much better than humans.</p>

<p>A loop really is just that, a way to tell the computer to perform the same task multiple times.</p>

	     <p>The best way to get started with python_in_chemistry is by working through the Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks series of notebooks. These will work through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an introduction to Jupyter notebooks and allow you to run them online through Binder;</li>
  <li>performing simple calculations, and using the <code>math</code> module;</li>
  <li>working with variables;</li>
  <li>different data types: integers and floats, strings, lists, and numpy arrays;</li>
  <li>plotting data with <code>matplotlib</code>;</li>
  <li>basic data analysis and statistics with numpy.</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be worked through from the links below:</p>

	  <title>Functions</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Functions are a fundamental aspect of many programming languages. They allow a programmer to both simplify their code by hiding away many lines of code into a single line, while reducing the amount of work a programmer needs to do, if they need to do the same thing many times.</p>

<p>The concept of a function will hopefully be familar from mathematics, e.g.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x)</script>

<p>where, <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> is some mathematical operation that acts on the argument <script type="math/tex">x</script>, while the details of the function are abstracted away. An example of a function is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = x^2</script>

<p>Using this we can say that <script type="math/tex">f(2) = 4</script>, <script type="math/tex">f(3)=9</script>, etc.</p>

<p>A function in programming is very similar, it consists of arguments and returns a value after some operation has taken place.</p>

<p>The Pythonic way to <em>define</em> a function is:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name_of_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">operation</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">def</code> tells the computer that you are wanting to <strong>define</strong> a function, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> tells the computer that this is the thing that should be sent back to the where the function is called.</p>

<p>The use of <strong>functions</strong> is an important paradigm in programming – the following Jupyter notebook gives some examples of functions and how they can be used.</p>
