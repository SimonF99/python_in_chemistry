	     <p>While teaching Python for data analysis in the first- and second-year computational labs in Bath, one of the most common questions I receive from students can be answered with this simple response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Please scroll to the bottom of that block of text and read the last bit”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those that have worked with Python before will <em>hopefully</em> know that I am talking about error tracebacks.</p>

<p><strong>Error traceback</strong> is the name for the print out appears when some error is found in the Python code, it is called a traceback because it aims to help you <em>trace back</em> to where the bug is. An example of a simple error traceback can be seen by running the following in a Python interpreter:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we are trying to import the numpy module, but have spelt numpy wrong. This code will return something which looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span>                       <span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ipython</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">73</span><span class="n">b7917897b3</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="o">----&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>

<span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">named</span> <span class="s">'numy'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, at first glance this can appear quite scary. However, just remember that the most important line in an error traceback is the <strong>last one</strong>, for this particular example we have:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ModuleNotFoundError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">named</span> <span class="s">'numy'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line alone should tell you what the problem in your code is…<strong>should</strong>. Although, remember though that these error traceback messages are written by other humans who originally wrote the code you are using, so the error message may not be perfectly clear. That said, in the above example just by reading the final line of the error traceback we will be able to quickly see that we’ve spelt numpy wrong.</p>

<p>Of course, not all problems can be solved by just reading the last line. The code below shows two possible attempts at using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> function (which should add a number to the end of an array). Here we are trying to add the next two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to the existing array:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this code gives the following error:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="n">AxisError</span>                                 <span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here it is not immediately why the error has arisen. The last line of the traceback seems to be incidating sum issue related to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">axis</code>, which in our ignorance about the <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> function, we know nothing about. However, there is another tip to help us solve this problem, which involves the <strong>arrow indicator</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">----&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This arrow incidates which line the error occured on, and is extremely useful as codes become become larger and more convoluted. In the above example the line indicates that the error has arisen on the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">a = np.append(a, 11, 19)</code>, and following investigation of the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.append.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">np.append()</code> documentation</a>, we can discover that the incorrect syntax has been used. The second argument needs to be an array (or list) if both numbers are to be added. The number <code class="highlighter-rouge">19</code> was understood to the be <em>axis</em> argument, for which 19 was not an allowed value. The line above features the correct syntax, hence there was no error found.</p>

<p>This of course is only the tip of the iceberg of error tracebacks and the amount of information available in them. But, hopefully this means people can spend less time waiting for me to help and more time debugging code yourself.</p>

	     <p><a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/author/andrew/">Andrew</a> has developed a small teaching utility designed to introduce students to molecular dynamics. He is currently in the process of trying to develop some example applications in the form of laboratory exercises. In the meantime, more information can be found <a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/pylj">here</a>.</p>

<p>This utility was applied at the ISIS Neutron Training Course as a component of Andrew’s lecture, the material for which can be found in the following post: <a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/introduction-to-md-ntc">introduction-to-md-ntc</a>.</p>

	     <p>This year I was invited to take part in the ISIS Neutron Training Course, a introductory course for neutron scattering scientists. The aim of our session was to introduce molecular dynamics and show how this could be applied to neutron scattering experiments. This involved a workshop showing how <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/arm61/falass/">falass</a> could be used to analyse neutron reflectometry and an introdcutory lecture outlining molecular dynamics.</p>

<p>To deliver this lecture, I decided to develop a small python utility that performs simple 2D argon simulations and provides visualisation that is both supported by Jupyter and easily extensible. The attached notebook is the result of this course.</p>

<p>It should be noted that due to the computationally intensive nature of MD, I recommend downloading the notebook, installing pylj via pip and running the notebook on your machine. On Window type the following into the Anaconda Prompt, on macOS or Linux type it into the terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install pylj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, make sure to also download the additional_code.py file as this makes the plotting easier (make sure that the additional_code.py file is in the same folder as the lecture when you launch the Jupyter notebook).</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjmorgan/python_in_chemistry/master/Neutron_Training_Course/lecture.ipynb">Download Lecture</a></p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjmorgan/python_in_chemistry/master/Neutron_Training_Course/additional_code.py">Download additional_code</a></p>

<p>(Right click and download the files)</p>

<p>There is currently a server running on which the lecture can be worked through. However, a password is needed, please email Andrew to gain access (arm61 ‘at’ bath.ac.uk). Check that out <a href="http://35.230.133.1/notebook/notebooks/lecture.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

	     <p>Functions are a fundamental aspect of many programming languages. They allow a programmer to both simplify their code by hiding away many lines of code into a single line, while reducing the amount of work a programmer needs to do, if they need to do the same thing many times.</p>

<p>The concept of a function will hopefully be familar from mathematics, e.g.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x)</script>

<p>where, <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> is some mathematical operation that acts on the argument <script type="math/tex">x</script>, while the details of the function are abstracted away. An example of a function is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = x^2</script>

<p>Using this we can say that <script type="math/tex">f(2) = 4</script>, <script type="math/tex">f(3)=9</script>, etc.</p>

<p>A function in programming is very similar, it consists of arguments and returns a value after some operation has taken place.</p>

<p>The Pythonic way to <em>define</em> a function is:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name_of_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">operation</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">def</code> tells the computer that you are wanting to <strong>define</strong> a function, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> tells the computer that this is the thing that should be sent back to the where the function is called.</p>

<p>The use of <strong>functions</strong> is an important paradigm in programming – the following Jupyter notebook gives some examples of functions and how they can be used.</p>

<p><a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bjmorgan/python_in_chemistry/master?filepath=General%2FFunctions.ipynb">Run the notebook</a></p>

	     <p>This notebook follows on from the <a href="/functions">functions</a> notebook. The aim here is to show the utility of <strong>loop</strong> in Python. Again I am aiming to use examples from <em>chemistry</em> related problems, but occasionally examples from physics and mathematics will come through.</p>

<p>As is the case with many aspects of programming, the purpose of a loop is to allow programmers to <em>write less code</em>. This leads to the idiom that <em>computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over</em>, much better than humans.</p>

<p>A loop really is just that, a way to tell the computer to perform the same task multiple times.</p>
