	     <p><a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/author/andrew/">Andrew</a> has developed a small teaching utility designed to introduce students to molecular dynamics. He is currently in the process of trying to develop some example applications in the form of laboratory exercises. In the meantime, more information can be found <a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/pylj">here</a>.</p>

<p>This utility was applied at the ISIS Neutron Training Course as a component of Andrew’s lecture, the material for which can be found in the following post: <a href="http://pythoninchemistry.org/introduction-to-md-ntc">introduction-to-md-ntc</a>.</p>

	     <p>This year I was invited to take part in the ISIS Neutron Training Course, a introductory course for neutron scattering scientists. The aim of our session was to introduce molecular dynamics and show how this could be applied to neutron scattering experiments. This involved a workshop showing how <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/arm61/falass/">falass</a> could be used to analyse neutron reflectometry and an introdcutory lecture outlining molecular dynamics.</p>

<p>To deliver this lecture, I decided to develop a small python utility that performs simple 2D argon simulations and provides visualisation that is both supported by Jupyter and easily extensible. The attached notebook is the result of this course.</p>

<p>It should be noted that due to the computationally intensive nature of MD, I recommend downloading the notebook, installing pylj via pip and running the notebook on your machine. On Window type the following into the Anaconda Prompt, on macOS or Linux type it into the terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install pylj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, make sure to also download the additional_code.py file as this makes the plotting easier (make sure that the additional_code.py file is in the same folder as the lecture when you launch the Jupyter notebook).</p>

	     <p>Functions are a fundamental aspect of many programming languages. They allow a programmer to both simplify their code by hiding away many lines of code into a single line, while reducing the amount of work a programmer needs to do, if they need to do the same thing many times.</p>

<p>The concept of a function will hopefully be familar from mathematics, e.g.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x)</script>

<p>where, <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> is some mathematical operation that acts on the argument <script type="math/tex">x</script>, while the details of the function are abstracted away. An example of a function is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = x^2</script>

<p>Using this we can say that <script type="math/tex">f(2) = 4</script>, <script type="math/tex">f(3)=9</script>, etc.</p>

<p>A function in programming is very similar, it consists of arguments and returns a value after some operation has taken place.</p>

<p>The Pythonic way to <em>define</em> a function is:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name_of_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argument</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">operation</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">def</code> tells the computer that you are wanting to <strong>define</strong> a function, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> tells the computer that this is the thing that should be sent back to the where the function is called.</p>

<p>The use of <strong>functions</strong> is an important paradigm in programming – the following Jupyter notebook gives some examples of functions and how they can be used.</p>

	     <p>This notebook follows on from the <a href="/functions">functions</a> notebook. The aim here is to show the utility of <strong>loop</strong> in Python. Again I am aiming to use examples from <em>chemistry</em> related problems, but occasionally examples from physics and mathematics will come through.</p>

<p>As is the case with many aspects of programming, the purpose of a loop is to allow programmers to <em>write less code</em>. This leads to the idiom that <em>computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over</em>, much better than humans.</p>

<p>A loop really is just that, a way to tell the computer to perform the same task multiple times.</p>
