    "This notebook will introduce the concept of functions in terms of the Python programming language. I will endevour to use examples of *chemistry* related problems, but occasionally examples from physics or mathematics will come through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many other programming languages Python lets you utilise functions -- in many ways these are a time saving methods so that you have to write less code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a function should be familiar from mathematics, e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(x)$ is some mathematical operation that acts on the argument, $x$. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this we can say that $f(2) = 4$, $f(3) = 9$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function in programming is very similar, it has arguments and returns a value after some operation has taken place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythonic way to *define* a function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>def name_of_function(argument):\n",
    "    operation\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>def</code> tells the computer that you are wanting to **def**ine a function, the <code>return</code> tells the computer that this is the thing that should be sent back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets try the mathematical example from above."
